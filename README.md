# Maze-Runner-Game
A mystery-dungeon style maze exploration game with an open and intricate combat system.<br>
The maze will contain items: weapons and armor for the player and potions for health restoration. As the player is exploring there will be a chance to run into an enemy monster and the player must fight them.<br>
The combat system will let both the player and enemy attack and destroy any part of the body with a wide selection of attack options depending on the weapon equipped.<br>
Weapons have 3 possible types of damage: Bludgeoning, Slashing, and Piercing damage. Each type of damage has a side effect.<br>
Bludgeoning attacks have a chance of damaging an opponent’s armor, making it less effective at reducing incoming damage.<br>
Slashing attacks have a chance to instantly cut off an opponent’s body part.<br>
Piercing attacks have a chance of dealing critical damage.<br>
Both the player and enemy are composed of various body parts and destroying vital parts such as the head, neck and upper chest will instantly cause death while destroying the parts of the arms or legs will result in the opponent being unable to use those parts to attack. The purpose of the game is to defeat the boss, whose chance of appearing increases as the player defeats more regular enemies. Once the boss is defeated, the player needs to escape the maze by finding the exit.
